This is a quick start guide to using Zsound's modules in your
Commander X16 projets.

+----------------------+
: 1: Build zsound.lib: :
+----------------------+
In the main zsound directory, use the make to build the archive:
make lib

This creates ./lib/zsound.lib

+------------------------+
: 2: Build the examples: :
+------------------------+

For each example, enter the directory and use build.sh to create
the various example programs. build.sh allows you to specify
which emulator/ROM version you wish to compile for:
cd examples/simpleplayer
./build.sh


+------------------------------------+
: 3: Use zsound in your own project: :
+------------------------------------+

To use zsound in your project, copy zsound.lib and the desired
include files into your project's folder:
cp lib/zsound.lib inc/*.inc /path/to/your/project/

Include the desired player in your assembly source:
.include "zsmplayer.inc"

The basic method for using any of the three players is to
first call its init routine prior to using any of the other
functions.

Typical usage pattern is:
init
start
call player once per frame
stop

To build your program with zsound, you must specify zsound as
a source file for the linker to use.

Case 1:
zsound.lib and .inc/.h files copied into your project's folder:

cl65 -t cx16 -o myprogram.prg myprogram.asm zsound.lib

Case 2:
Zsound headers and library in the zsound project folder:

cl65 -t cx16 -I/path/to/zsound/include --asm-include-dir /path/to/zsound/inc \
-o MYPROGRAM.PRG main.c foo.c bar.asm /path/to/zsound/lib/zsound.lib

+-----------------------+
: 4: The tools scripts: :
+-----------------------+

Either copy the scripts from tools into a folder in your executable
path, or add the tools folder to your path environment variable.
This is pretty much the same with any command-line utilities you
install. Whatever method you use should be fine.

PHP
The current tools are written in PHP. While PHP is known as a
web scripting language, you do not need to have any kind of
web server installed or running to use PHP. If it is not
available, then feel free to install just the command-line
interpreter.

+--------------+
: 5: Resources :
+--------------+

Several VGM files are included in the resources directory
Use the vgm2zsm tool to convert them into ZSM.

e.g.:
vgm2zsm rastan.vgm RASTAN.ZSM
(assuming vgm2zsm is in the path)

There is a large archive of VGM packs available at http://vgmrips.net
Furthermore, you can use Deflemask to author your own music. Use its
VGM export feature to write your music out to a VGM file, and then
convert it using vgm2zsm

As vgm2zsm supports the YM2612, you can use the Sega Genesis mode of
Deflemask to have 3 square wave PSG channels and one noise channel
at the cost of 2 FM channels. Use standard mode, not 3-CH mode, as
3-CH mode is not supported by the conversion script, as there is no
way I can think of to even simulate this on YM2151. Also, vgm2zsm
does not yet support the PCM/DAC track so plan accordingly in your
compositions.

Deflemask's Arcade mode uses the YM2151 as the sound chip, as well as
the Sega PCM chip (Sega Arcade, not Genesis) for PCM tracks.

At this time, neither the SegaPCM nor the YM2612 DAC (Genesis Digital
audio) are supported by the tools, but ZSM format was designed to
allow this funtionality in the future.

As for the ZFX sound effects, those currently must be built by hand.
Hopefully, either I or someone in the community will create an sfx
authoring tool for the format.

: 6: PCM :
+--------+

If you wish to play PCM audio, you can use tools such as sox or
Audacity to export raw PCM data. Export it as raw, 8 or 16 bit SIGNED
values, stereo or mono, and at whatever sample rate you require.

Load the PCM data somewhere into banked RAM, create a table of the PCM
parameters, and call pcm_triggerdigi with a pointer to the table to
start playback. (see example programs for further details)

Note that pcmplayer.inc and pcmplayer.h provide a struct for the PCM
parameter table used to trigger digi plaback.

ZCM format is another option. The tools folder includes a utility to
add a digitab header to raw PCM files (future enhancements will support)
WAV, MP3, etc as input types). When loading a ZCM formatted file, be sure
to use headerless mode (added in Kernal revision r39). Once loaded, your
program may overwrite the first 3 bytes with the actual memory location of
the PCM sample data. When loading a ZCM file, this address will be 8 bytes
past the address where the ZCM was loaded.


An example of converting a WAV file using sox:
sox example.wav -t raw -b 8 -c 1 -r 16000 -e unsigned-integer EXAMPLE.PCM
